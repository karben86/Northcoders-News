# Northcoders News App

I created this project as part of my coding bootcamp at Northcoders to practice my front-end skills. My code is available on Github at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and the app is hosted on Netlify at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Description

This app is a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website similar to a service such as Reddit.

Northcoders News has articles which are divided into topics. Each article has user curated ratings and can be up or down voted using the API. Users can add comments about an article which can also be up or down voted. A user can add comments and remove any comments which they have added but not affect comments of other users.

For the purpose of testing this app we are automatically logged in as "jessjelly".
